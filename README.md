# Blogging-Platform

This is a RESTful API that would power a personal blog. This implies that you’d have to create a backend API with the following responsibilities:

  Return a list of articles. You can add filters such as publishing date, or tags.
  
  Return a single article, specified by the ID of the article.
  
  Create a new article to be published.
  
  Delete a single article, specified by the ID.
  
  Update a single article, again, you’d specify the article using its ID.
